Reference Establishing Norms

Roles
Taskmaster
Gitmaster
Testmaster
Daily process
Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster #(Morning Standup at 10:30)
New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
Pair program on assigned tasks
Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master
#Regroup at 5-5:30 depending on the re-group meeting at lunch. If a specific #component will cause bugs or have merge issues, wait until completed to #merge.
#From 5-6 still be coding, however be able to communicate with others for #feedback. (Will be in zoom room)
#Breakout rooms will be open for random code review if need be.

Team expectations
#Rule 1 ⇒ Keep it real
#Rule 2 ⇒ If you have something come up, talk with the team. We are all flexible and understand. If you can’t finish the task in time, let the others know. We can always help. Conversely, if you finish with your task and you see someone is struggling, offer to help out.
#Rule 3 ⇒ If your message is not answered right away, understand that we may be coding for a while, but we will always get back to you in a timely fashion. (Don’t bomb the chat, we most likely see it, but are focused heavily).
Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
Share the mic
Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
At least message the group when you change what you are working on
Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
Take 10-15 minute break
List out the pros / cons
Vote on it
If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
If you are frustrated
Take a walk or get some water
Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate
